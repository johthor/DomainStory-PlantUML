# Domain Storytelling with PlantUML

DomainStory-PlantUML uses [PlantUML](http://en.plantuml.com/) to describe and
document a domain story which was developed in a
[Domain Storytelling](http://www.domainstorytelling.org) workshop.

## Getting Started

At the top of your domain story `.puml` file,
you need to include the `domainStory.puml` file found in the root of this repository.

The library is now part of the [PlantUML Standard Library](https://plantuml.com/en/stdlib)
and may be included via

```puml
!include <domainstory/Domainstory>
```

If you want to use the always up-to-date version in this repository,
use the following `include` definition

```puml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johthor/DomainStory-PlantUML/main/domainStory.puml
```

To be independent of any internet connectivity,
you can also download the file found in the root
and reference it locally with

```puml
!include path/to/domainStory.puml
```

After you have included `domainStory.puml` you can use the predefined macro
definitions for the domain story actors:

* `Person($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`
* `Group($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`
* `System($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`

As well as the domain story work items:

* `Document($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`
* `Folder($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`
* `Call($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`
* `Email($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`
* `Conversation($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`
* `Info($name[, $label][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])`

Activities between actors and involving work items are described via the `activity` macro:

```puml
activity($step, $subject, $predicate, $object[, $post][, $target][, $objectArr][, $targetArr][, $color][, $scale][, $shape][, $note])
```

In addition to these,
it is also possible to define boundaries via `Boundary($name[, $label][, $backgroundColor][, $shape][, $note])`.

Optional parameters are shown above in square brackets.

![pictographic language](assets/pictographicLanguage.svg)

Now let's create our first domain story:

```puml
@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johthor/DomainStory-PlantUML/main/domainStory.puml

Boundary(Party) {
    Person(Alice)
    Conversation(weather)
    Person(Bob)
}

activity(1, Alice, talks about the, weather, with, Bob)
@enduml
```

![basic sample](assets/basic.svg)

More information can be found here:

* [Domain Storytelling](http://www.domainstorytelling.org)
* [REAL WORLD PlantUMLâ€”Sample Gallery](https://real-world-plantuml.com/)

### Basic Concepts

Some concepts or constructs will be used throughout the library.

#### Name and Label Parameters

Almost all the parameters declared above are optional and may be omitted for a simplified story description.
But all of them may be specified via named parameters so that some parameters are skipped.
In general, the parameters at the beginning of the parameter list are to be used as positional parameters,
while parameters at the end of the parameter list are more likely to be used as keyword parameters.
Keyword parameters may even be skipped as they always have sensible default handling.

Every actor, work object and boundary accepts the parameters `$name` and `$label`
where only `$name` is mandatory while `$label` is optional.
If no label was given, the name will be reused as a label.
All elements may later be referenced by their names.

With that in mind `Person(Bob, $scale=42)` is a totally legal way of describing a giant person named and labeled Bob.

#### Positioning Indication

Some elements may be positioned in relation to another reference element via a positioning indicator.
Here the following symbols are used on multiple occasions.

* `^` _caret_ symbol: the new element will be positioned above its reference
* `>` _greater-than_ symbol: the new element will be positioned to the right of its reference
* `v` _vee_ symbol: the new element will be positioned below its reference
* `<` _less-than_ symbol: the new element will be positioned to the left of its reference

The positioning indicator will take the normal story flow defined via `$storyLayout` into account.

## Basic Features

Some of the features that will be used right away.

### Basic Story Layout

For single story diagrams, a landscape orientation e.g. `left-to-right` is preferred
and is therefore the default orientation.
If you combine multiple stories into a domain journey,
a portrait orientation usually gives better results.
The orientation can be configured at the top of your file via

```
!$storyLayout = "landscape | left-to-right | top-to-bottom | portrait"
```

> :information_source: Wrangling diagram elements to an exact position
> or layout is not what PlantUML is for.

If the default layout does not please your inner artist,
there are some possibilities to improve it.

Group elements together via `together { elements... }`.

The `activity` macro provides another feature for better layout control.
Where the step value can be combined with a [positioning indicator](#positioning-indication)
(`^`, `>`, `v`, `<`).

The following activity will be directed to the left of Alice.

```puml
activity(1<, Alice, talks about the, weather, with, Bob)
```

More details and a second activity direction feature will be discussed
in [Advanced Story Layout](#advanced-story-layout).

### Auto-Incrementing Steps

The activities will be numbered by default and may keep track of the current step number automatically.
Therefore, when describing activities,
the current step label supports multiple special value specifications to control the behavior.

| Step Value                 | Description                                                                                                             | Auto Increment |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `_` _underscore_           | sequential step                                                                                                         | yes            |
| `\|` _bar_                 | parallel step                                                                                                           | no             |
| `.` _full stop_ / _period_ | hidden step counter                                                                                                     | no             |
| ` ` _space_ or '' _empty_  | hidden step counter                                                                                                     | no             |
| `n` _any integer_          | step label will be `(n)`                                                                                                | no             |
| `=n` _equal sign_ prefix   | step label will be `(n)`<br/>and step counter will be set to that integer<br/>_auto-increment will continue from there_ | no             |

See the following test case for more details [step labels and auto increment](test/activityStepCounter.puml)

```puml
activity(_, Bob, talks about the, weather1) /' auto-increment will create step 1 '/
activity(_, Bob, talks about the, weather2) /' auto-increment will create step 2 '/
activity(|, Alice, talks about the, weather2) /' no increment will create step 2 '/
' will not create step, nor auto-increment, and will not display the step label
activity(.<, Bob, also talks about the, weather3)
activity(42, Alice, asks about all the, talking1, again, Bob) /' will create step 42 '/
activity(|, Bob, talks about the, weather4) /' no increment will still create step 2 '/
' will create step 10 and set the step counter to 10
activity(=10, Alice, talks about, talking2, Bob)
activity(_<, Bob, is embarrassed about, talking3) /' auto-increment will create step 11 '/
' will not create step, nor auto-increment, and will not display the step label
activity( , Alice, writes, mail, to, Bob)
```

### Adding Notes or Annotations

All elements support adding notes via the keyword argument `$note`.

```puml
Boundary(wonderland, $note=like Oxford) {
  Person(Alice, $note=fizz)
  Conversation(weather, $note=buzz)
  Person(Hatter)
  activity(1, Alice, talks about the, weather, with, Hatter, $note=sunny)
}
```

When adding a note on an activity,
the note will be added to the object of that activity.

Furthermore, the first symbol of the note text may act as a [positioning indicator](#positioning-indication)
where `^`, `>`, `v` or `<` controls the direction in which it is placed from its element of reference.
Otherwise, it will be placed in the default direction from its element.

Notes may also be placed via the basic PlantUML mechanism.

```puml
Boundary(wonderland) {
    Person(Alice)
    Document(bottle)
}
note bottom of Alice : main character
note top of bottle : drink me
note right of wonderland : visit me
```

See the following test cases for more details

* [Notes on actors and work objects left-to-right orientation](test/notesOnElements-leftToRight.puml)
* [Notes on actors and work objects top-to-bottom orientation](test/notesOnElements-topToBottom.puml)
* [Notes on boundaries left-to-right orientation](test/notesOnBoundaries-leftToRight.puml)
* [Notes on boundaries top-to-bottom orientation](test/notesOnBoundaries-topToBottom.puml)

### Basic Styling

The appearance of a domain story may be influenced via any of the following methods.

> :information_source: You may also mix and match all the approaches to get the look you desire.

**Method 1: PlantUML Themes** The library is compatible with [PlantUML themes](https://plantuml.com/en/theme) like
`sunlust` or `sketchy` and others.
Choose the theme before including the library.

**Method 2: Default Appearance** If no theme is used, a fallback design is used which is heavily inspired
by [Egon.io](https://egon.io/).

**Method 3: Custom Style definitions** The appearance of most of the elements may be customized via the following global
style declarations.
These will also work if a theme is used.
Make sure that your values are compatible with the chosen theme.

| Property         | Default Value   | Description                                         |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `$storyLayout`   | `left-to-right` | Basic direction of the activity arrows              |
| `$textColor`     | `#0b0c10`       | Color of all text                                   |
| `$actorStyle`    | `default`       | Use outlines instead of filled icons for actors     |
| `$actorScale`    | `1`             | Size of actor icons                                 |
| `$actorColor`    | `#1f2833`       | Color of actors icons                               |
| `$actorShape`    | `agent`         | Shape of actor elements                             |
| `$objectStyle`   | `default`       | Use outlines instead of filled icons for work items |
| `$objectScale`   | `0.8`           | Size of work item icons                             |
| `$objectColor`   | `#1f2833`       | Color of work item icons                            |
| `$objectShape`   | `card`          | Shape of work item elements                         |
| `$boundaryColor` | `#1f2833`       | Color of boundary borders                           |
| `$boundaryShape` | `#1f2833`       | Shape of boundary containers                        |
| `$activityColor` | `#c5c6c7`       | Color of the activity arrows                        |
| `$stepColor`     | `#66fcf1`       | Background color for step numbers                   |
| `$stepFontSize`  | `16`            | Font size for step numbers                          |
| `$stepFontColor` | `$textColor`    | Font color for step numbers, same as `$textColor`   |
| `$noteColor`     | `#c5c6c7`       | Background color for notes                          |
| `$noteBorder`    | `#1f2833`       | Border color for notes                              |

To use your own styling, you need to define the relevant styling properties before including the library.
The following example would combine green actor icons with red text.

```puml
@startuml
' !theme <theme name> /' optional '/

!$textColor = "red"
!$actorColor = "green"

!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johthor/DomainStory-PlantUML/main/domainStory.puml

Person(Alice)
@enduml
```

> :information_source: You might want to set a matching `$stepColor` and `$stepFontColor` when using themes.

**Method 4: Individually Styled Elements** Every element allows some control over its appearance via the `$color` and
the
`$scale` parameters.
The following example code shows a "Little Red Riding Hood."

```puml
Person(hood, Riding Hood, $color=red, $scale=0.5)
```

See the following test cases for more details

* [Using theme `sketchy`](test/stylingTheme-sketchy.puml)
* [Using theme `sunlust`](test/stylingTheme-sunlust.puml)
* [Custom style definitions and individually styled elements](test/stylingCustom.puml)

### Extensions

If the default actors and work objects are not enough to express your specific needs,
see the [extensions sample](samples/extensions.puml) for a way to add new actors and objects.

![extensions sample](assets/extensions.svg)

## Advanced Features

These features might come handy after you've used the library for quite some time.

### Dynamic Creation of Work Objects

Instead of predefining all work objects,
they can also be defined on the fly when they are used.
Prefix the work object with the kind of object you want to create
followed by a colon e.g. `Conversation:`.

Additionally, you can specify the color and scale of the created work object
via the keyword arguments `$color` and `$scale`

```puml
@startuml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johthor/DomainStory-PlantUML/main/domainStory.puml

Boundary(System) {
    Person(Alice)
    Person(Bob)
    activity(1, Alice, talks about the, Conversation: weather, with, Bob, $color = red, $scale = 2)
}
@enduml
```

> :warning: **If you want your dynamically created objects to be placed inside a boundary.**
> You need to declare the activity inside said boundary.

See the test case for [dynamic object creation](test/activityObjectCreation.puml) for more details.

### Advanced Story Layout

If the aforementioned lay-outing techniques described in [Basic Story Layout](#basic-story-layout) are not enough,
the `activity` macro supports even more layout tricks.

In addition to the step counter specifications described above,
the step value may also specify the direction of the activity where `X` is one of the specifications above.

| Step Value                     | Description                                | Auto Increment |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `X>` _greate-than sign_ suffix | direction of activity will be to the right | depends on X   |
| `X<` _less-than sign_ suffix   | direction of activity will be to the left  | depends on X   |
| `Xv` _vee_ suffix              | direction of activity will be downwards    | depends on X   |
| `X^` _caret_ suffix            | direction of activity will be upwards      | depends on X   |

See the test cases for more details

* [activity directions for left-to-right layout](test/activityDirection-leftToRight.puml)
* [activity directions for top-to-bottom layout](test/activityDirection-topToBottom.puml)
* [activity directions for both layouts](test/activityDirection-bothLayouts.puml)

Furthermore, the `activity` macro also provides two optional parameters,
which allow you to specify the arrow orientation in full details.

* `$objectArr` will define the arrow direction between the subject and the object
* and `$targetArr` will define the arrow direction between the object and the target.

Some possible arrow specifications are `-->`, `->`, `<-`, `<--`, and `-up->`.
For more details,
see [The Hitchhiker's Guide to PlantUML](https://crashedmind.github.io/PlantUMLHitchhikersGuide/layout/layout.html#arrows-for-layout).

```puml
activity(1, Alice, talks about the, weather, with, Bob, -->, ->)
```

You can use underscores `_` in cases where you don't have a _post action_,
or _target_ but want to specify the arrow orientation directly.
When you specify only the arrow between subject and object,
the specification will also be used for the arrow between object and target.
So the following lines describe all more or less the same activity.

```puml
activity(1, Alice, talks about the, weather, , Bob, <--, <--)
activity(1, Alice, talks about the, weather, Bob, _, <--)
activity(1, Alice, talks about the, weather, _, _, <--)
```

If all of that does not help your layout problems,
there's always the possibility to introduce hidden connections
only for layout purposes.
Remember that every element of your story may be referenced by its name later.

```puml
Bob ---[hidden]-> Alice
```

See the test cases again for more details

* [activity directions for left-to-right layout](test/activityDirection-leftToRight.puml)
* [activity directions for top-to-bottom layout](test/activityDirection-topToBottom.puml)
* [activity directions for both layouts](test/activityDirection-bothLayouts.puml)

### Advanced Styling

In addition to the styling methods described in [Basic styling](#basic-styling) there are more advanced methods.

**Method 5: Configuring the Element's Shapes** By default, the library will use the
following [PlantUML shapes](https://plantuml.com/en/deployment-diagram) to represent actors, work objects and
boundaries.

* actors will use the shape `agent`
* work objects will use the shape `card`
* and bound will use the shape `rectangle`

But these shapes may be reconfigured via the global styling declarations `$actorShape`,
`$objectShape` and `$boundaryShape` and the `$shape` parameters on every element.

**Method 6: Styling via Skinparam or Style**
